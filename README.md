# week10

My business idea is to have a self-driving food truck that delivers coffee, morning beverages and pastries.  The customer will order/ pay/ tip all from an app. It will be a cross between an adult ice cream truck and uber. 
The espresso would be the best quality (roasted by Heart Roasters in Portland) and prepared by extremely skilled baristas  using the finest machines available. The pastries would be served fresh (par-baked in the morning then finished baking on the truck per order *). 
The other beverages available would include kombucha , fresh squeezed juices and water. Also different kind of headache medicine would be available for treating hangovers:)
Your order would be delivered in porcelain to your door on a tray with a fresh flower.  There would deposit for the tray/ plates/ mugs ( all good looking stuff you would want to keep anyway). The app would remind you what you have to give back to the delivery person. 

*This would smell incredible.
